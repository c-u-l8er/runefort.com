   a retracted claim coming back, a rung invented, a call to action the rung has
   not earned, an unrendered token, a dead mailbox, an unreadable caveat, a
   documented path that resolves to nothing, an artifact that is not what its
   source compiles to, an animation whose internals have leaked into the copy.
