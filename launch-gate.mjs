   3c. r15 — THE BUILD PUBLISHES FILES THIS CHECK NEVER READ

   r14 was "the gate reads one file; the HOST serves a directory." This is the
   same defect one layer inward: the BUILD writes more than one file, and a
   text rule that reads only index.html is not a rule. It was demonstrated on
   opensentience.org, where a retracted count was planted in a comment inside
   a published script and the gate reported green — three of that build's four
   emitted files were exempt from every text rule it had.

   This build writes three files. The two that are not the page get a HARD
   ZERO on every retracted string: a script has no retraction block to hold a
   quotation, so an occurrence in one is a reinstatement with nowhere to hide.
   Same for a mailto:, an email address and an unrendered template token.

   The vendored ./amp-nav.js is deliberately NOT in this set — it is written
   by ampersand-nav/sync-nav.sh and only lane N may change it. It is covered
   separately, and honestly, in §5.

   15. THE COMPUTED COLOUR ON A REAL .btn — NOT THE ONE THE TOKEN DECLARES
   SHELL.md r7. Travis reported the header CTA unreadable. It was: `.top nav a`
   is specificity 0,2,1 and `.btn` is 0,1,0, so the nav rule won and the button
   painted --fg2 on the accent at 1.19:1 — while the identical button in the
   hero painted its declared dark ink at 12:1.

   EVERY CONTRAST CHECK ABOVE PASSED THE WHOLE TIME. They read the DECLARED
   token pair (#ink on --acc) and never the colour the cascade actually gives a
   real element in its real ancestor context. That is the entire hole, and it is
   why this surface's deliberate-break count could not have caught it.

   So: resolve the cascade over the ARTIFACT — every rule that sets `color` or a
   custom property, matched against each .btn's real ancestor chain, with
   specificity, source order, !important, @media at a given width, var() and
   inherit — and refuse when a button's computed colour is not the one a .btn
   rule declares for it.

   Two properties keep the resolver honest rather than merely quiet:
     · any selector or media condition it cannot parse is a REFUSAL, never a
       skip. A resolver that silently ignores the rule it does not understand
       has reproduced the blind spot it was written to close.
     · finding zero buttons is a REFUSAL. A check that passes because it
       measured nothing is the same failure wearing a green tick.

     · a real `action` on a real `<form method="POST">`, so it posts with
       JavaScript off. A fetch bolted to a button is a form that stops working
       the moment a script fails, on a page whose whole argument is that its
       content does not depend on scripts.
     · the `_gotcha` honeypot. A honeypot dropped in a refactor fails SILENTLY —
       nothing breaks, the spam just arrives — which is exactly the class of
       defect a gate is for.
     · `role="status" aria-live="polite"` on the reply, or the outcome is
       invisible to a screen reader.
     · and still no `mailto:` anywhere (checked above; this replaces the GitHub
       issues fallback as the primary channel, it does not reintroduce a mailbox).
